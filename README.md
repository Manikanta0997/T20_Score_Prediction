T20 Score Prediction
The T20 Score Prediction project aims to predict the first inning score of a T20 cricket match based on various input parameters. It takes into account the batting team, bowling team, city, number of overs completed, and the number of wickets down. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the project generates an estimation of the first inning score. The frontend of the application is developed using Streamlit and deployed on Streamlit sharing.
